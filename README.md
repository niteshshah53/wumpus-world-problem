# Wumpus World

The Wumpus world is a simple world example to illustrate the worth of a knowledge-based agent and to represent knowledge representation.

The figure below shows a Wumpus world containing one pit and one Wumpus. There is
an agent in room [1,1]. The goal of the agent is to exit the Wumpus world alive. The
agent can exit the Wumpus world by reaching room [4,4]. The wumpus world contains
exactly one Wumpus and one pit. There will be a breeze in the rooms adjacent to the
pit, and there will be a stench in the rooms adjacent to Wumpus.

This is a python program that uses propositional logic sentences to check which rooms
are safe. The inference is drawn using the DPLL algorithm with 4 heuristics: Early termination, Pure symbol heuristic, Unit clause heuristic and Degree heuristic. 

It is assumed that there will always be a safe path that the agent can take to exit the Wumpus world. The logical agent can take four actions: Up, Down, Left and Right. These actions help
the agent move from one room to an adjacent room. The agent can perceive two things:
Breeze and Stench.
